#  Setup perl environment to run fitbot on your

#
################################################


1) Install strawberry perl on your machine:

http://strawberryperl.com/



2) Install all of the modules that fitbot leverages. 
	- You can see the modules fitbot uses because they are imported with the 'use' statement in the code. 
	- You can search all Perl modules at www.cpan.org
	- The easiest way to install a module is not from the website, but through command line (http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html).
		a) Open command line (cmd.exe) on your machine.
		b) From the command line use the command 'cpan' to install the modules needed.
		c) Here are all the modules (I think) used by fitbot. Run these commands. 
			cpan Time::localtime
			cpan Bot::BasicBot
			cpan XML::LibXML
			cpan POSIX
			cpan DBI
			cpan LWP::UserAgent
			
			

3) Download the 3 fitbot files:
	- fitbot.pl 	- Main bot functionality.
	- sql.pl 		  - Code that interacts with the database through the DBI module.
	- pastebin.pl	- Code that generates text url based on tny.cz API

	
	
4) Put the 3 Perl files in the same directory on your computer. 



5) In fitbot.pl, change line 16 to the irc channel that you'd like to go to.



6) In fitbot.pl, change line 28 to give fitbot a different name.



7) To execute a perl program you can do it through command line with the command(perl fitbot.pl) or just double click fitbot.pl
